# dotfiles
These are some of my personal dot files I use.
Not very intuitive, but they work for me.

Being a fan of modularity, I've broken down `~/.bashrc` in many small `.` files and then sourced them in `/.bashrc` later.


|   File name   |                       Description                           |
|:-------------:|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|`.bash_aliases`| Aliases to make lives easy.                                 |
|`.git_aliases` | Who loves typing 'git cherry-pick' hundereds of times a day.|
|`.functions`   | Aliases with extended functionality.                        |
|`.archive`     | Archival functions to make extraction and archiving easy.   |
|`.envars`      | Ease of setting up environment.                             |

`.updatenotify` is a script that notifies you with number of available updates after every reboot in your bash prompt :sunglasses:
